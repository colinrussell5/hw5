## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?
  There are 1852 different chocolate bars that have been rated in the data set.
```{R}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
choc = read.csv("https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs/data/choco.csv")
nrow(choc)
head(choc)
```

2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.
  The number of ratings incremented almost linearly, but dropped off heavily after the year 2015.
```{R}
year = table(choc$Review.Date)
barplot(year, main="Chocolate Rating Based on the Year", xlab="Year", ylab = "Chocolates Rated")
```

1. How are ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
    A large majority of chocolate bars fall inbetween a 2.5 rating and 4. The ratings from 1-2 are         outliers due to them having very few data points compared to the rest of the graph.
```{r}
hist(choc$Rating, main="Rating Distribution", xlab="Rating", ylim = c(0,700))
```

2. Do ratings depend on the cocoa percentage of a chocolate bar?
    Cocoa percentage and rating are indepdent from one another. 
```{r}
attach(choc)
plot(Rating, Cocoa.Pct, xlab="Cocoa Rating", ylab="Cocoa %")
```

3. How do ratings compare across different company locations? Focus on the three locations with the most ratings:
    The ratings across the 3 countries are similar and have almost identical medians.
```{r}
top3 = dplyr::filter(choc, Company.Location %in% c("U.S.A.", "France", "Canada"))
ggplot(top3, aes(x = Company.Location, y = Rating)) + geom_boxplot()
```


My Own Question:
Is there any relationship between REF and Rating?
    There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the two variables.
```{R}
ggplot(data=choc, aes(x=REF, y=Rating)) + geom_jitter()
```
